# Playground project for rendering cheatsheets

Limited re-usability. Mostly for fun.

Design goals:
* Render structured cheatsheets as PDF using PDFBox
* Auto layout
* Allow for content and style adjustment while retaining consistent look and feel

## Todo
    

	
 * NATS CLI Cheatsheet   
    * Google for a good style for technical cheatsheets
    * Implement cheatsheet style
    
 * NATS sweet spot start cheatsheet
 
    * Here is my 2 cents.  What's unique about NATS from the little I have read is that it is kinda like Solace+Kafka all in one i.e. you get streaming like Kafka and you get eventing like Solace.  For Small/medium size enterprises this combination is highly appealing as you have lower operational and resource requirement costs (assuming we are competitive on the licensing costs) and you get maybe 80% (I am pulling this number out of back pocket) of the functionality of both. For large enterprises (i.e. 2B+) we can play the complementarity game: we can play with both Kafka and Solace; they stay on-prem ad NATS is the edge !

    * Good point, plus "lightweight, embeddable and scales from the edge to the Cloud"
